Hey, Iâ€™m Atobouh Ariel! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a student with a passion for cybersecurity and a love for coding. Iâ€™m all about understanding how things work, breaking them (ethically, of course ðŸ˜‰), and then putting them back together even stronger. When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in code or exploring the latest in cyber defense, youâ€™ll probably find me geeking out over tech, solving CTF challenges, or just tinkering with new tools.

Iâ€™m still learning, growing, and making mistakes (itâ€™s part of the process, right?), but Iâ€™m excited to share my journey, collaborate on cool projects, and connect with others who are just as obsessed with tech as I am.

Letâ€™s build, break, and secure things together!  or Not ðŸš€
